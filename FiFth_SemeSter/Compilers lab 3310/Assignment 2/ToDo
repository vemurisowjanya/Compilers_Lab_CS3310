printing final output (BE CAREFUL)
nothing to type check in the public static void main() (???)
why is this (identifierlist) even present??
System.exit(0);						//*****************doubtful****************
Can method and class have same name???
restrictions on type of x in System.out.println(x);    (for now it is an integer)
no two consecutive methods on the stack
suggestions given in moodle(redeclaring the ,methods or classes)  -------------done------------
